You can usually get away with not maintaining your beard neckline when you’re just sporting stubble. But once it goes beyond 3mm and starts turning into a short beard, you need to reach for your trimmer.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Neat. Tidy. Well defined.</b></p>\n<p>Just because you can’t see your own beard neckline doesn’t mean you can forget about how scruffy it’s getting. Most beards look much better with a well maintained neckline, so it’s time to face the question of how high or low you should go. Here’s how to trim a beard neckline that means business:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Step 1: Know where to stop</b></p>\n<p>Look straight in the mirror, holding your head upright. Any hairs below an imaginary line running below your chin definitely have to go. Now.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Step 2: Define the line</b></p>\n<p>Tilt your head back a bit and place one finger of your other hand just at the top of your Adam’s apple. This spot marks a natural dividing line between your beard and your neck.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Step 3: Take your cue from the center</b></p>\n<p>Place your trimmer at this spot and trim down. (If you use a Philips Beard Trimmer 9000, the handy laser guide will show you where your trimming line will be.) Continue on one side, working outwards from the middle, ensuring you stay under the jawline. Return to the middle, and work outwards on the other side. Don’t make your beard neckline too round – a slight upcurve is best.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Step 4: Stay square or go round</b></p>\n<p>Define the corners of your beard by trimming a vertical line below your ear lobes to connect with the horizontal line below your chin. You can leave this as a chiselled, angular corner (very macho) or gently round it off to make less of a statement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Step 5: The finishing touch</b></p>\n<p>Like it? If you’re happy with your trim, follow through with your shaver to make your beard neckline something your collar will feel proud to be seen with. Or just set your Philips Beard Trimmer 9000 to its 0.4mm setting for a very close final trim. The laser guide is also an easy way to create perfect cheeklines, so what are you waiting for?</p>\n","description":"","tags":[{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Beard Maintenance","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+beardmaintenance","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/beardmaintenance"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Beard Trimmer","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+beardtrimmer","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/beardtrimmer"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Shortbeard ","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+short-beard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/short-beard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App Detail","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app+appdetail","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app/appdetail"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Beard Advice","key":"malegroomingkeywords++general+beard-advice","id":"malegroomingkeywords:general/beard-advice"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":false,"name":"Man","key":"malegroomingkeywords++man","id":"malegroomingkeywords:man"}]},{"previewimage":"","spotlightLogo":"","newsfeedLogo":"","modDate":"1521548881997","overlay":"","linkurl":"","partnername":"","portraitimage":"","title":"Facial Hair Styles","link":"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/choosing-a-facial-hair-style-that-fits-your-face.html","uid":"","imageUrl":"/content/dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/usa/choosing a facial hair style that fits your face/facial-hair.jpg","text":"<p><b>The great thing about the abundance of hair on the male form is that there are so many ways to alter the way you look. This might mean a change of hairstyle, new facial hair or, ahem, simply sprucing up your undercarriage.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Which hairstyles are hot?</b></p>\n<p>If you’re thinking of trying out a new hairstyle, it’s often a good idea to ask your barber for some help in choosing a style that suits you. Maybe you’ve already got a style in mind – if so, why not bring in a picture of the style you’d like to try?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the most popular&nbsp;<i>s</i><i>tyles du jour</i>&nbsp;is the smart short back and sides favored by Ryan Gosling in the film Drive. The look oozes classic Hollywood style but is still a bit rough around the edges. Okay – that’s your hair sorted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What about your facial hair?</b></p>\n<p>Choosing a style to wear on your face can be a bit harder, especially if you’ve never experimented much in the past. So here are a few tips on how to choose a style that suits your features from beard and mustache expert Dr Allan Peterkin*.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>The right style should complement your face</b></p>\n<p><i>“When choosing a facial hairstyle, consider the size of your facial features. If a man has a large nose, a pencil-thin mustache will look like a hairy mistake instead of a style statement. Similarly, a man with a tiny nose should avoid a big, bushy ‘stache – which will make his nose look even smaller in comparison. The right style should complement your face without overpowering it or being overpowered by it. Here are some general guidelines:</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>If you’ve got large facial features (mouth, nose, eyes, and chin), go for a larger, bushier mustache or beard style. It will balance out your facial features and provide a softer look.</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>If you have a prominent nose, consider a larger, thicker mustache such as a Chevron, Painter’s Brush or Handlebar, but steer clear of thinner designs.</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>A long, narrow face requires a narrow-to-medium-sized mustache that’s not too heavy in length or design. Stick to shorter styles and skinnier lines, such as the Clark Gable, Chaplin, or Military mustaches. Stay away from styles with vertical lines – such as the Horseshoe – that will only accentuate the length of your face.</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>If you’ve got an extra large mouth, choose an angular style such as the Pyramid mustache that’s narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. The variety in length and angles will minimize the size of your mouth.</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>Don’t overpower a smallish mouth with a big, bushy mustache. Instead, go for a shorter style. Growing the ‘stache a little past the corners of your mouth will make your mouth appear a bit larger.</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>If you’ve got a wide mouth with a big upper lip, consider a large, bushy mustache with a parting that divides the mustache into two sections.”</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Tidy up with a quick shave</b></p>\n<p>After carefully trimming the outline of whichever beard or mustache style you pick, it’s likely that you’ll need to shave the rest of your face. So why not finish off giving yourself a new look by shaving in a new way?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Shave in the shower with Philips AquaTouch</b></p>\n<p>One way to freshen up your shaving routine is to do it in the shower. New shavers such as the&nbsp;<u>Philips AquaTouch</u>&nbsp;have a specially designed Aquatec seal that mean they can be used both in the shower and as a normal dry shaver. This means you get the closeness of your normal shave but with the added convenience of choosing where you do it. And your new style will be accompanied by a fresh, clean you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>*Reprinted with permission from the book The Bearded Gentleman: The Style Guide to Shaving Face by Allan Peterkin and Nick Burns (Arsenal Pulp Press)</i></p>\n","description":"","tags":[{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App Detail","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app+appdetail","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app/appdetail"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Anchor Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+anchorbeard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/anchorbeard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Chevron Mustache","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+chevronmustache","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/chevronmustache"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Handlebar Mustache","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+handlebarmustache","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/handlebarmustache"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Zappa Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+zappabeard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/zappabeard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Facial Hair","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+facialhair","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/facialhair"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"How To","key":"malegroomingkeywords++general+howto","id":"malegroomingkeywords:general/howto"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Van Dyke","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+vandyke","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/vandyke"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":false,"name":"Man","key":"malegroomingkeywords++man","id":"malegroomingkeywords:man"}]},{"previewimage":"","spotlightLogo":"","newsfeedLogo":"","modDate":"1519980987548","overlay":"","linkurl":"","partnername":"","portraitimage":"","title":"The Beard Cheek Line","link":"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/how-to-trim-a-perfect-cheekline.html","uid":"","imageUrl":"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/usa/how-to-trim-a-perfect-cheekline/how-to-trim-a-perfect-cheekline-small-block.jpg","text":"<p><b>Nobody loves a weird beard..

Basically you’ve got two options: a natural beard cheekline or a defined beard cheekline.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Natural beard cheekline</b></p>\n<p>This is a friendly and natural look, but it’s not suitable for every man. It’s softer than a defined cheekline and makes your beard (and face) look bigger.

It looks cleaner and gives your face an edgier look. Here’s how to create one:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>1. Define the cheekline of your beard</b></p>\n<p>Try to visualize where your ideal cheekline should be. This is easier if you use a Philips Beard Trimmer 9000, which has a handy laser guide to show you where your trimming line will go. Visualize the start and end points of your cheekline: A is where it begins, at the bottom of your sideburns, and B is where it meets the side of your moustache.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>2. Trim your cheekline</b></p>\n<p>Once you’ve defined your line, it’s time to create it. Using the Philips Beard Trimmer 9000. Switch the laser on to check your line and start trimming above the line. You can go down to 0.4mm with the lowest setting on this trimmer, so you can use it for your beard neckline too.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>3. Maintain it</b></p>\n<p>Depending on your daily beard growth and skin type, keep your cheeks clean by shaving above your cheekline with a Philips Series Shaver or a Philips Styleshaver.</p>\n","description":"","tags":[{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Beard Maintenance","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+beardmaintenance","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/beardmaintenance"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Full Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+fullbeard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/fullbeard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App Detail","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app+appdetail","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app/appdetail"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Shortbeard ","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+short-beard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/short-beard"}]},{"previewimage":"","spotlightLogo":"","newsfeedLogo":"","modDate":"1519980819748","overlay":"","linkurl":"","partnername":"","portraitimage":"","title":"The Handlebar Mustache","link":"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/how-to-create-the-handlebar-mustache.html","uid":"","imageUrl":"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/usa/how-to-grow-handlebar-mustache/handlebar-mushtache-small.jpg","text":"<p>1.Pick up your trusty trimmer and trim your mustache to about 1/8 to 1/5 of an inch.

But it represents my masculinity! The natural progress of most beards is as follows: five o’clock shadow; stubble; short beard; full beard; Bluebeard. Try to stop before you get to that last stage.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What does beard trimming involve?</b></p>\n<p>Your facial adornment will look its best if you can give it an even length all over, a proper beard neckline, cheekline mustache &nbsp;and lipline. Here’s how:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Step 1: The all-over trim</b></p>\n<p>Wash and dry your beard. Set your trimmer to its longest setting, and trim your beard all over. Go against the direction of hair growth to remove excess bulk. Repeat using shorter trim settings until you’re happy with the length.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Step 2: Define your neckline</b></p>\n<p>For the perfect beard neckline, put a finger horizontally just above your Adam’s Apple and trim a vertical strip below this line. Work outwards under your jawline to one side, return to the center and work your way to the other side. If using a Philips Beard Trimmer 9000, the laser line will show you precisely where to trim. (You are only excused this step if you’re sporting stubble.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Step 3: Follow through with a shave</b></p>\n<p>Grab your Philips Series Shaver and shave off the trimmed hairs below your new beard neckline.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Step 4: Choose your cheekline</b></p>\n<p>If you’re happy with a natural beard cheekline, leave it as it is. For an edgier, crisper look, go for a straight or slightly rounded line to the bottom of your sideburns. The lower your cheekline, the more lenth you’ll give to your face.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Step 5: Shape up your mustache</b></p>\n<p>You can trim your mustache itself to the same length as your beard, or leave it slightly longer to make it stand out more. For a nice, clean lipline, close your mouth and smile. Keep your mustache cleen and trim the bottom of your mustache (without the trimmer comb) to create a 1 mm clear line above your lips (optional).</p>\n","description":"","tags":[{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Beard Maintenance","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+beardmaintenance","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/beardmaintenance"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Full Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+fullbeard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/fullbeard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Stubble","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+Stubble","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/Stubble"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App Detail","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app+appdetail","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app/appdetail"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":false,"name":"Man","key":"malegroomingkeywords++man","id":"malegroomingkeywords:man"}]},{"previewimage":"","spotlightLogo":"","newsfeedLogo":"","modDate":"1519980724487","overlay":"","linkurl":"","partnername":"","portraitimage":"","title":"Beard Care - Maintaining your beard","link":"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/maintaining-your-beard.html","uid":"","imageUrl":"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/usa/how-to-grow-full-beard/full-beard-small.jpg","text":"<p><b>October 9, 2014</b></p>\n<p><b>Growing a great beard is an achievement to be proud of, but it’s far from the end of the story. What do you do with all that hair on your face? Do you treat it just like the hair on your head, or does it require special attention? Here’s what you need to know about beard care.</b></p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><b>Facial hair never stands still</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first thing you need to bear in mind is that your beard and mustache are in perpetual motion. No matter how beautifully and precisely you’ve trimmed them into an impressive style, they’ll soon grow out of it again. The general rule is that shorter styles need to be trimmed more often than longer ones, simply because an extra 1mm of growth is more noticeable if your beard or mustache is short. In that case, build in a little extra time into your morning routine every day or two to keep your style the perfect length. For a longer style, once or twice a week may be enough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Cleanliness is key</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you’re used to treating your face to no more than a quick splash of water morning and evening, your beard or mustache may complain they’re not getting enough attention. Keep them looking – and smelling – good by shampooing them under the shower, adding a touch of conditioner if your hair’s coarse or rough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Become a softie</b></p>\n<p>Everyone’s beard hair is different: for some men, it grows neatly downwards, while for others it sticks straight out. If yours does the latter, dab on some beard oil and comb the hairs downwards. Beard oil softens the hairs, while pomade can be used to shape your beard or mustache into the right style. You don’t have to fill your bathroom with dozens of expensive products – just a few good basic ones are all you need.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Tool up</b></p>\n<p>If you’re serious about looking good, your bathroom toolkit should include a trimmer (including a trimmer comb and a precision attachment), a mini foil shaver and a rotary shaver. Some tools such as the Philips Norelco Styleshaver or Philips Norelco Multigroom have several different features, enabling you to do more than one job with the same device.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Behave like a beardie</b></p>\n<p>Wear your beard and/or mustache with pride. To avoid making it dirty or greasy, try not to touch or stroke it too much. Trim the hairs around your lips, and practice eating and drinking without getting anything stuck in your facial hair. Another thing you’ll need to practice is modestly saying “So do I”. It’s a good reply to a phrase you’re likely to hear a lot: “I like your beard.”</p>\n","description":"Tips on how to maintain a beard","tags":[{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App Detail","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app+appdetail","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app/appdetail"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Beard Advice","key":"malegroomingkeywords++general+beard-advice","id":"malegroomingkeywords:general/beard-advice"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Beard Maintenance","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+beardmaintenance","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/beardmaintenance"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Stubble","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+Stubble","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/Stubble"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Grooming Tips","key":"malegroomingkeywords++grooming+Grooming-Tips","id":"malegroomingkeywords:grooming/Grooming-Tips"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app"}],"assets":[{"youtubeid":"MZuVL4RgUsc","originalimage":"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/usa/how-to-grow-full-beard/full-beard-small.jpg","thumbnail":"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/usa/how-to-grow-full-beard/full-beard-small.jpg","type":"YOUTUBEVIDEO"}]},{"previewimage":"","spotlightLogo":"","newsfeedLogo":"","modDate":"1519979410744","overlay":"","linkurl":"","partnername":"","portraitimage":"","title":"Beard Growing Tips","link":"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/the-full-beard-get-the-full-picture.html","uid":"","imageUrl":"https://www.usa.philips.com/c-dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/usa/the-full-beard-get-the-full-picture/the-full-beard-get-the-full-picture-small-block.jpg","text":"<p><b>If you’re the kind of guy who never does things by halves, the Full Beard is the style for you.
