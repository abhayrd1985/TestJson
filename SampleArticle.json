The Facial Hair Style That Suits Your Face","uid":"","imageUrl":"https://stg.philips.com/c-dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/master/article025/header-L.jpg","text":"<p><b>Which hairstyles are hot?</b></p>\n<p>If you’re thinking of trying out a new hairstyle, it’s often a good idea to ask your barber for some help in choosing a style that suits you. Maybe you’ve already got a style in mind – if so, why not bring in a picture of the style you’d like to try?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the most popular styles du jour is the smart short back and sides favored by Ryan Gosling in the film Drive. The look oozes classic Hollywood style but is still a bit rough around the edges. Okay – that’s your hair sorted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What about your facial hair?</b></p>\n<p>Choosing a style to wear on your face can be a bit harder, especially if you’ve never experimented much in the past. So here are a few tips on how to choose a style that suits your features from beard and mustache expert Dr Allan Peterkin*.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>The right style should complement your face</b></p>\n<p>“When choosing a facial hairstyle, consider the size of your facial features. If a man has a large nose, a pencil-thin mustache will look like a hairy mistake instead of a style statement. Similarly, a man with a tiny nose should avoid a big, bushy ‘stache – which will make his nose look even smaller in comparison. The right style should complement your face without overpowering it or being overpowered by it. Here are some general guidelines:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you’ve got large facial features (mouth, nose, eyes, and chin), go for a larger, bushier mustache or beard style. It will balance out your facial features and provide a softer look.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have a prominent nose, consider a larger, thicker mustache such as a Chevron, Painter’s Brush or Handlebar, but steer clear of thinner designs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A long, narrow face requires a narrow-to-medium-sized mustache that’s not too heavy in length or design. Stick to shorter styles and skinnier lines, such as the Clark Gable, Chaplin, or Military mustaches. Stay away from styles with vertical lines – such as the Horseshoe – that will only accentuate the length of your face.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you’ve got an extra large mouth, choose an angular style such as the Pyramid mustache that’s narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. The variety in length and angles will minimize the size of your mouth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Don’t overpower a smallish mouth with a big, bushy mustache. Instead, go for a shorter style. Growing the ‘stache a little past the corners of your mouth will make your mouth appear a bit larger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you’ve got a wide mouth with a big upper lip, consider a large, bushy mustache with a parting that divides the mustache into two sections.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Tidy up with a quick shave</b></p>\n<p>After carefully trimming the outline of whichever beard or mustache style you pick, it’s likely that you’ll need to shave the rest of your face. So why not finish off giving yourself a new look by shaving in a new way?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Shave in the shower with Philips AquaTouch</b></p>\n<p>One way to freshen up your shaving routine is to do it in the shower. New shavers such as the <a href=\"https://www.philips.co.uk/c-m-pe/face-shavers/aquatouch-shavers/all#layout=96.priceDesc.p-grid\" target=\"_blank\">Philips AquaTouch</a> have a specially designed Aquatec seal that mean they can be used both in the shower and as a normal dry shaver.

His career has taken him across the globe; today he is the most sought-after men’s stylist in the world. We interviewed him to find out more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Q: Salon Pour Hommes offers a total grooming experience for men: haircuts, coloring, facial trims, brow tweezing and manicures – as a boutique service. What do you think is the driving force behind the renewed interest in male grooming?</b></p>\n<p>A: I think it’s been going on for a couple of years now, but in the ‘60s and ‘70s men's hair styling was very big. Barbershops offer some services – but men mostly go to them for a quick beard trim. When salons started to become more unisex, the male grooming industry lost its identity: many men didn’t feel comfortable in unisex places.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In fact, we haven’t created anything new: we’ve just bought male grooming back from the past. Male grooming is not just about getting styled – it’s about the service aspect too. In our salon, we’ve created semi-private stations. You only see the people working with you; your stylist, your pedicurist and so on. No one is invading your privacy or seeing you with the hair products on… no man wants to be seen with that in his hair.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Q: Looking their best is very important for a lot of men - what’s the most outrageous thing a client has done to secure your hair styling services?</b></p>\n<p>A: Two weeks ago someone was 15 minutes late – I didn’t have enough time for their barber appointment. They offered to pay double. I told them, “Come on, pay triple.” (He laughs). Seriously though, some clients will spend a fortune to fly me out at the last minute. They cannot face the word “no”. I have one regular client I see every month: it’s a two-day job, round-trip. Sometimes I get there and he only has 15 minutes to spare.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Q: What are the latest facial hair styling trends in NYC?</b></p>\n<p>A: There are lots of hair styling looks and trends. People in New York are so good at perfecting their own style. The big ‘50s pompadour hairstyle, with a lot of height and pushed back, nicely tapered and groomed on the sides, is really coming back. It’s a real classic hairstyle but can be styled very avant-garde. We’re finally growing hair again – I love it – facial hair’s getting longer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think we’re finally done with the old spiky look. Mohawks and things, they’re getting tacky…though of course some people can still look great in those hairstyles. With facial hair, anything goes. The less it’s groomed, the better it looks…especially with a beard. You should exaggerate the beard. The hair on your head should be more groomed, and should be worn pushed back.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Q: What are the top 5 looks?</b></p>\n<p>A: The old hairstyle trends are coming back. Men are much more in touch with the different hairstyles they can sport, and how preppy they can be. It’s the feeling of, “I’m gonna groom my hair very well, it’s gonna be really shiny and it’s gonna smell very good.” So a hairstyle product is very important, and men are much more knowledgeable than they used to be.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It used to be that guys would use one shampoo and one gel from the supermarket. Now they really want styling advice. Things like blow-drying, flat irons, curling irons. Now guys love to create different hairstyles from one haircut. We all have a professional life – then we like to go crazy at night. We all want to control our image and have different looks for those moments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Q: Which mustache or beard is your favorite to create?</b></p>\n<p>A: The movie The Artist has put an older era back in people’s minds again.The Artist Mustache has got to be one of my top favorites: it’s very dressy, very cool. You can kill it quickly or grow it quickly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Q: So are you a clean-shaven gent or a big beard guy?</b></p>\n<p>A: Funnily enough, I don’t shave much. I trim for a 5 o’clock shadow. It makes me look skinny, and it’s all about the skinny look for me.</p>\n","description":"Martial Vivot’s Salon Pour Hommes is the place to go in New York for men’s hair styling.

Basically you’ve got two options: a natural beard cheekline or a defined beard cheekline.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Natural beard cheekline<br>\n </b>This is a friendly and natural look, but it’s not suitable for every man. It’s softer than a defined cheekline and makes your beard (and face) look bigger. An advantage of the natural option is that you only need to take care of your beard neckline, so you’ll need less time for your daily grooming routine.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Defined beard cheekline<br>\n </b>For a neater, sharper appearance, go for a defined cheekline. It looks cleaner and gives your face an edgier look. Here’s how to create one:<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>1. Define the cheekline of your beard<br>\n </b>Try to visualise where your ideal cheekline should be. This is easier if you use a <a href=\"https://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/BT9280_33/beardtrimmer-series-9000-waterproof-beard-trimmer-with-worlds-first-laser-guide\">Philips Beard Trimmer 9000</a>, which has a handy laser guide to show you where your trimming line will go. Visualize the start and end points of your cheekline: A is where it begins, at the bottom of your sideburns, and B is where it meets the side of your moustache.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>2. Trim your cheekline<br>\n </b>Once you’ve defined your line, it’s time to create it. Using the Philips Beard Trimmer 9000? Switch the laser on to check your line and start trimming above the line. You can go down to 0.4mm with the lowest setting on this trimmer, so you can use it for your beard neckline too.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>3. Maintain it<br>\n </b>Depending on your daily beard growth and skin type, keep your cheeks clean by shaving above your cheekline with a <a href=\"https://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/S9031_26/shaver-series-9000-sensotouch-wet-and-dry-electric-shaver-with-smartclean-and-aquatec-wet-and-dry\">Philips Shaver Series 9000</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/YS534_17/click-style-smartclick-comfortcut-heads-3-in-1-tool\">Philips Styleshaver.</a></p>\n","description":"Nobody loves a weird beard..

It's no wonder it's seen such an emphatic return to fashion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>You can join them!</b></p>\n<p>That rejuvenation is no mistake - there's a lot of scope to craft a goatee into something that will truly grace your face. Many people just don't realize there are so many goatee styles to choose from - well, we at Philips are here to educate you about them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Don't let yourself down in the goatee stakes</b></p>\n<p>If the above list of illustrious names does anything, it should have alerted you just how high standards are in the more rarified circles of 'goatee-dom'. If, therefore, you are going to 'go goatee' at all, you really need to do it with panache - which couldn't be easier when you experiment with the following goatee styles:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Goatee with Soul Patch</b></p>\n<p><b>Get your beard 'training wheels'!</b></p>\n<p>A Soul Patch is a small hair tuft connecting a wearer's goatee to their lower lip, and it's a pretty easy style to achieve and maintain - indeed, Soul Patches have even been described as 'training wheels' for a full-on beard, although some more advanced goatee wearers may be a little offended at the imputation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>An emblem of '50s chic...</b></p>\n<p>Goatee styles that also incorporate a Soul Patch pay handsome homage to the 1950s artists and beatniks who made this low-maintenance facial hair option so popular, not to mention the jazz trumpeters who are said to have first introduced it out of rather more practical considerations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>...that remains relevant to the present day</b></p>\n<p>Of course, there's not much functional purpose to a Soul Patch now, but then, the same can be said of a goatee... so fill your boots. Oh, and remember to regularly shave the rest of your face and reshape your patch with a stubble or precision trimmer to keep your overall goatee and Soul Patch looking sharp.</p>\n<p>Read more about the <a href=\"https://www.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/how-to-create-the-soul-patch.html\">Soul Patch</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/master/article033/Goatee-styles2.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Goatee with Handlebar mustache</b></p>\n<p><b><i>The </i></b><b>facial hair for the most elitist hipsters</b></p>\n<p>It might just be the holy grail of aristocratic hipsterdom - the goatee with a Handlebar mustache. We've written previously on the Handlebar mustache, which somehow manages to exude both 19th-century upper-class sophistication and a hint of cowboy. Combining this 'tache with a goatee, however, helps to offset that slightly elitist look.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>But it isn't actually that hard to achieve</b></p>\n<p>It takes a lot of diligence to grow a Handlebar mustache, even when you don't have a goatee to worry about, but that doesn't necessarily make this combo the sole preserve of hardcore beardists. Quite the opposite - in the first week of 'tache-growing, also grow out a standard '90s goatee for a nicely complementary look.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/master/article033/Goatee-styles3.png\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Join the legends with this fabled combo</b></p>\n<p>The end results will be more than worthwhile - a lovely busy Handlebar 'tache that Wyatt Earp himself would have been proud of, plus a goatee that he quite possibly wouldn't have been. Don't forget to invest heavily in wax for the daily shaping of your mustache once it has grown in.</p>\n<p>Read more about the <a href=\"https://www.philips.co.uk/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/how-to-create-the-handlebar-mustache.html\">Handlebar mustache</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Chin Puff</b></p>\n<p><b>Not a goatee for shrinking violets</b></p>\n<p>Some goatee styles are shy, sitting on the face but not really putting themselves forward. The Chin Puff, though, is an entirely different beast. There's a certain amount of dedication needed to actually grow and maintain a Chin Puff, which is a thin, slightly elongated U-shaped beard that starts at the lower lip and extends down past the chin.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>The steps to your dream Chin Puff</b></p>\n<p>So, why not set yourself apart with something that’s very definitely not 'just another goatee'? The first step is to simply grow a conventional beard, which can then be shaped into the exact style of chin decoration you desire. Starting at the ears, shave inwards, switching sides periodically, and once you get to the chin area, shave from side by side in order to achieve a nice central position for the Chin Puff, finishing off with a trimmer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>An ideal facial hair pairing...</b></p>\n<p>When the Chin Puff is combined with a Handlebar mustache, the result is a look that might have observers wondering whether you are a 19th century courtier who has just been teleported into 21st-century Britain. But of course, why should this combination be such a surprise? After all, the Handlebar 'tache and the Chin Puff are both very proud styles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Petite Goatee</b></p>\n<p><b>Dip your toes in the water of goatee-dom</b></p>\n<p>This upside down teardrop number starts just beneath the lips and extends slightly beyond the chin. As the name suggests, it is a smaller, partial goatee that you might fancy trying if you are still indecisive about your longer-term participation in goatee-dom, or if you just struggle to achieve the facial hair growth required for a larger goatee.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>A goatee that demands maintenance</b></p>\n<p>Like many other goatee styles, the Petite Goatee needs to be carefully groomed and manicured in order to maintain its subtle appeal. Nonetheless, a well-kept Petite Goatee can be a fine facial hair addition, giving you that touch of class without the need for a more substantial beard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>But creating one is simple enough</b></p>\n<p>Your chin hairs need to be at least half an inch in length in order to be styled into a Petite Goatee, so you should resist shaving your chin hair during the early growing stages. Indeed, the process of growing a Petite Goatee basically involves spending two weeks growing a normal goatee before you get to work on shaping it into a Petite Goatee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Sparrow</b></p>\n<p><b>A goatee with true Hollywood appeal&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>Johnny Depp has a lot to answer for in the goatee world, not least in regard to one of the most iconic goatee styles of all, named after his <i>Pirates of the Caribbean </i>character, Captain Jack Sparrow. You can achieve a Sparrow by shaving your face entirely except for your Soul Patch, before growing out the hair at the bottom of your chin until you are able to make two plaits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>This one has to be seen to be believed!</b></p>\n<p>The result is surely the most spectacular goatee of all, and definitely not the sole preserve of pirate fans. The full Jack Sparrow look isn't just about the goatee, however, it effectively combines multiple facial hair styles, including the goatee, chinstrap and Handlebar mustache.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Keep your Sparrow in tip-top shape</b></p>\n<p>Maintenance of this goatee style involves regular trimming, shaving and daily grooming, including the use of wax to help preserve the shape. Like other beards, the Sparrow can attract random bits of food, so keeping your goatee both clean and shaped is essential.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Goatee with connected mustache (Circle Beard)</b></p>\n<p><b>The goatee that breaks the sacred rule</b></p>\n<p>It is the mortal sin of goatee-dom - attaching it to a mustache. What are you <i>thinking</i>, man?? Goatee purists won't thank you for this one, constantly reminding you that any goatee that blends seamlessly with a 'tache simply isn't a goatee.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Attack of the name game</b></p>\n<p>Also referred to as a Circle Beard, this trespasser into the world of goatee styles has been confused with 'true' goatees since at least the 1990s. Still, it's your face that you're playing with! This 'tache and goatee beard combo should not be confused with the Van Dyke, which involves growing your goatee up towards your mustache without the two actually meeting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Don't be afraid to experiment!</b></p>\n<p>Circle Beards offer plenty of scope for flaunting different styles. Some are round, others are square, yet others are hexagonal... but in many ways, the most impressive thing about any Circle Beard is how neatly shaved its various angles are. Not for no reason do the likes of George Michael, Kanye West and Leonardo DiCaprio love this goatee style.</p>\n<p>Read more about the <a href=\"https://www.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/a-360-tour-around-the-circle-beard.html\">Circle Beard</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n","description":"Discover the different goatee styles that exude cool.\n\nIt's been a long time since the goatee was an object of derision, worn only by those who were seriously unhip.

There's just something about beards. They seem to say so much about the wearer - their tastes, their values and simply the kind of person they are. So it's no surprise that we remain, and will probably always be fascinated by beard styles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Beards: still relevant in the 21st century!</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And so we fast-forward to today, when the beard is once again the epitome of cool and one of the principle ways in which men - even those who are barely on nodding terms with the neighborhood hipsters - express their style. With so many beard styles now possible, including combinations of facial hair, it's difficult to deny the beard's continued relevance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><b>Acquiring - or re-acquiring - your beard mojo</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sure enough, then, if you would like to learn how to grow a beard, you have plenty of style options. With variety famously being the spice of life, a Full Beard gives you more than enough tastes to sample. Depending on how you grow and trim it, your own Full Beard can look anything from classic to weird. Giant beard styles are intrepid, while medium and small ones are bold and cool.</p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><b>Our rundown of the different beard styles</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Are you ready to experiment with the different beard styles out there, or take on a whole new look? Assuming you can grow enough chin fur to play around with, and don’t mind being stared at as you walk down the street, here are some of the beard styles that you might like to try:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Short Boxed Beard</b></p>\n<p>This is the traditional way of wearing a Full Beard. Your sideburns, mustache and beard combine to form an all-in-one display of masculinity. By shaving your upper cheeks and neck and trimming the rest, you define the shape and keep the whole thing tidy. A classic beard look.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Short Boxed Beard might be one of the best all-round beard styles - showing a certain class and restraint, this is the beard that you can wear to work each day without causing much of a fuss. You won't look like a full-on Neanderthal, but this beard still radiates a certain timelessly rugged look.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You do need to regularly shave the hair that grows below and around your actual beard in addition to doing some trimming every now and then, but the results will make all of that effort more than worthwhile. As it works with your natural beard shape, a Short Boxed Beard will probably suit you irrespective of the shape of your face.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Long Beard</b><b></b></p>\n<p>The accessory of choice for rock stars or extreme creatives, this is one of those beard styles that deserves to be worn with a confident gaze. Just remember to style your Long Beard, otherwise before you know it, it’s turned white, reached your knees, and people are calling you Gandalf.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wondering how to grow a beard that's a little on the longer side? Here's our handy cut-out-and-keep guide: first, grow it and secondly, maintain it. Alright, so the process is a little more complicated than that, not least the need to regularly trim the sides and use the appropriate beard grooming products. Yes, that's right, such things do exist.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Don't underestimate the importance of your lifestyle in encouraging the longer beard styles to grow more quickly - regular exercise and a Paleo diet can both make a big positive difference. Sugar will achieve much the opposite effect. Resist trimming your long beard until it reaches the desired length, as long as it doesn't become too shaggy in the meantime.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>French Fork Beard</b><b></b></p>\n<p>Want a truly different look? Pirate Jack Sparrow has made the French Fork beard possibly the coolest of all beard styles once more. And if you´re wondering about the name, it´s because French forks originally only had two prongs. As Jack would know, of course.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are one of the approximately six people in the world who are unfamiliar with <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>, the French Fork beard is still easy to pick out from other beard styles, thanks to the hair that extends past the chin before splitting down the middle into two segments - or 'prongs'.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The French Fork beard may have once been considered too extravagant and Satanic-looking for most people's tastes, but Jack Sparrow has done much to change that and highlight this beard's perhaps oft-overlooked artfulness. It is a Full Beard style that&nbsp; well deserves its return to fashion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Stiletto beard</b><b></b></p>\n<p>Rounded at the sides and perfectly pointed at the end, this is one of the harder beard styles to achieve, but it looks great when combined with short hair. It isn't the most common of beard styles, but then, with two months of growth required to achieve it, that might not be too big a surprise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Stiletto beard is most often recognised by the central point at which the wearer's chin hair concludes, but it's easy to underestimate the work that goes into creating this style - such as the two deep 'U' shapes that you will also need to trim under your mouth in order to draw the eyes downwards.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may need some gel to shape your beard correctly into a kind of ducktail shape. You’ll know you’ve got it right when old ladies start throwing bread. Use oil to keep your Stiletto beard nice and soft, and trim it regularly to make sure it stays in shape. Tada! What you end up with is surely a beard style to rival all others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read more about the <a href=\"https://www.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/how-to-create-the-stiletto-beard.html\">Stiletto beard</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>The Amish (Old Dutch) Beard</b><b></b></p>\n<p>Mostly worn by hyper-literate guys, this Full Beard is worn square and without a mustache. Sometimes the top of the chin is left bare too. This more old school beard style, connected by sideburns and typically flaring outwards at the bottom, is popular with the Amish, who speak Pennsylvanian Dutch – actually a dialect of German.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Downsides? You might be mistaken for a lumberjack. Unless you are one, of course... in which case, as you were. If you want to ward off such accusations, pair it with a more modern - but nonetheless complementary - hairstyle and pay plenty of attention to grooming.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Definitely one of the more time-honoured beard styles, the rugged masculinity of the Old Dutch beard has nonetheless persisted through the current generation of more understated beards. It has even made a fair few appearances on the catwalk as of late, so you might even be bang on trend with this one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Klingon beard</b><b></b></p>\n<p>“It’s a beard, Jim, but not as we know it.” On the face of it (geddit??), the Klingon beard is proof that watching too much Star Trek can play havoc with your facial hair choices. But could there be benefits to wearing face-fluff named after a ficticious race of aliens?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Well, you might be lucky enough to get chatting to a hot lady Trekkie at the bar. But more than that, the Klingon beard is one of those beard styles that achieves a certain cool through its weirdness. Not many men can really pull off a Klingon beard, but those who do can expect turned heads.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To create a Klingon beard, grow a full beard before trimming it neatly. Then, shave off the mustache on your upper lip without interefering with where the mustache and beard connect. Finally, be dazzled by the end result. You don't even necessarily need to be a Star Trek fan to love this most unique of beard styles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Verdi beard</b><b></b></p>\n<p>One of the coolest beard styles out there today, this is a short, round-bottomed beard named after the composer who wore it whilst writing some of his best operas. You should wear your Verdi beard with slightly shaven cheeks to show off the interesting mustache.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Indeed, the mustache - which is separate from the beard - is a vital detail. Not only must it never grow more than 1.5cm beyond the corners of your mouth, but you must also keep it immaculately groomed. Violate any of these rules, and you will be laughed out of the next performance of <i>La Traviata</i>. Well, probably.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just as important as the technical aspects of growing and maintaining a Verdi beard are the interests of the kind of person who wears one. Some beard styles may be better for going out on the pull, but if you're more one for discussing the finer points of <i>Il Trovatore</i> or <i>Rigoletto</i> in your favourite historic pub, you really ought to don a Verdi beard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Santa Beard</b></p>\n<p>Is it real? Can I pull it? Not if you want any presents this Christmas. Yep, some people really do deliberately grow their beards every year to resemble the legendary bringer of presents and 'ho hos' himself, Father Christmas. They might do it for commercial gain, or they may instead be petty criminals wanting to get down people's chimneys without anyone suspecting their true motives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's a good rule of thumb to already be old enough to have the white hair, and don't expect too many dates, given a Santa beard's ability to increase your apparent age&nbsp; by another couple of decades. Mind you, such sacrifice might be worth it to see the looks of delight on the faces of the local children every December.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are seriously considering this beard of all beard styles, start phoning around shopping malls for grotto opportunities. After all, let's face it... there's almost no reason to grow a Santa beard, unless you do a pretty mean 'Ho, ho, ho' or have literally exhausted all other beard styles that ever existed... ever.&nbsp;</p>\n","description":"","tags":[{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App Detail","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app+appdetail","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app/appdetail"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Brett Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+brettbeard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/brettbeard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":false,"name":"Man","key":"malegroomingkeywords++man","id":"malegroomingkeywords:man"}],"title":"Beard styles and what to call them"},{"portraitimage":"","previewimage":"","spotlightLogo":"","newsfeedLogo":"","modDate":"1519981530192","overlay":"","linkurl":"","partnername":"","uid":"","link":"https://stg.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/how-to-trim-a-beard.html","imageUrl":"https://stg.philips.com/c-dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/master/article033/small-block.jpg","text":"<p><b>What does beard trimming involve?</b><br>\nYour beard will look its best if you can give it an even length all over, a proper beard neckline, cheekline mustache and lipline. Here’s how:<br>\n<br>\n<b>1. The all-over beard trim</b><br>\nWash and dry your beard. Set your beard trimmer to its longest setting, and trim your beard all over. Go against the direction of hair growth to remove excess bulk. Repeat using shorter trim settings until you’re happy with the length.<br>\n<b><br>\n 2. Define your neckline</b><br>\nFor the perfect beard neckline, put a finger horizontally just above your Adam’s Apple and trim a vertical strip below this line. Work outwards under your jawline to one side, return to the center and work your way to the other side. If using a Philips Beard Trimmer 9000, the laser line will show you precisely where to trim.

For an edgier, crisper look, go for a straight or slightly rounded line to the bottom of your sideburns. The lower your cheekline, the more length you’ll give to your face.<br>\n<br>\n<b>5. Shape up your mustache</b><br>\nYou can trim your mustache itself to the same length as your beard, or leave it slightly longer to make it stand out more. For a nice, clean lipline, close your mouth and smile.

What do you do with all that hair on your face? Do you treat it just like the hair on your head, or does it require special attention? Here’s what you need to know about beard car</b><b>e.<br>\n <br>\n Facial hair never stands still<br>\n </b>The first thing you need to bear in mind is that your beard and mustache are in perpetual motion. No matter how beautifully and precisely you’ve trimmed them into an impressive style, they’ll soon grow out of it again. The general rule in beard care is that shorter styles need to be trimmed more often than longer ones, simply because an extra 1mm of growth is more noticeable if your beard or mustache is short. In that case, build in a little extra time for beard care into your morning routine every day or two to keep your style the perfect length. For a longer style, once or twice a week may be enough.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p ><b>Cleanliness is key in beard care<br>\n </b>If you’re used to treating your face to no more than a quick splash of water morning and evening, your beard or mustache may complain they’re not getting enough attention. Keep them looking – and smelling – good by shampooing them under the shower, adding a touch of conditioner if your hair’s coarse or rough.</p>\n<p ><br>\n<b>Become a softie</b><br>\nEveryone’s beard hair is different and asks for special beard care:&nbsp;for some men, it grows neatly downwards, while for others it sticks straight out. If yours does the latter, dab on some beard oil and comb the hairs downwards. Beard oil softens the hairs, while pomade can be used to shape your beard or mustache into the right style. You don’t have to fill your bathroom with dozens of expensive products – just a few good basic beard care products are all you need.</p>\n<p><br>\n<b>Tools for beard care<br>\n </b>If you’re serious about beard care and looking good, your&nbsp;bathroom toolkit should include a trimmer (including a trimmer comb and a precision attachment), a mini foil shaver and a rotary shaver. Some tools such as the Philips Styleshaver or Philips Multigroom have several different features, enabling you to do more than one job with the same device.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Behave like a beardie</b><br>\nWear your beard and/or mustache with pride. To avoid making it dirty or greasy, try not to touch or stroke it too much. Trim the hairs around your lips, and practice eating and drinking without getting anything stuck in your facial hair. Another thing you’ll need to practice is modestly saying “So do I”. It’s a good reply to a phrase you’re likely to hear a lot: “I like your beard.”</p>","description":"","tags":[{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Grooming Tips","key":"malegroomingkeywords++tips+groomingtips","id":"malegroomingkeywords:tips/groomingtips"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Facial Style","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+facialstyle","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/facialstyle"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App Detail","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app+appdetail","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app/appdetail"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Full Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+fullbeard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/fullbeard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Short Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+shortbeard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/shortbeard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Chevron Mustache","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+chevronmustache","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/chevronmustache"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Scruffy Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+scruffybeard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/scruffybeard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":false,"name":"Man","key":"malegroomingkeywords++man","id":"malegroomingkeywords:man"}],"title":"Beard Care - Maintaining your beard"},{"portraitimage":"","previewimage":"","spotlightLogo":"","newsfeedLogo":"","modDate":"1519980108455","overlay":"","linkurl":"","partnername":"","uid":"","link":"https://stg.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/most-timeless-facial-hair-styles-top-5.html","imageUrl":"https://stg.philips.com/c-dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/usa/most-timeless-facial-hair-styles-top-5/top5-small.jpg","text":"","description":"","tags":[{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Grooming Tips","key":"malegroomingkeywords++tips+groomingtips","id":"malegroomingkeywords:tips/groomingtips"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Facial Hair","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+facialhair","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/facialhair"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Shortbeard ","key":"malegroomingkeywords++beard+short-beard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:beard/short-beard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Handlebar Mustache","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+handlebarmustache","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/handlebarmustache"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Soul Patch","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+soulpatch","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/soulpatch"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Short Beard","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+shortbeard","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/shortbeard"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App Detail","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app+appdetail","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app/appdetail"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Original Goatee","key":"malegroomingkeywords++styling+originalgoatee","id":"malegroomingkeywords:styling/originalgoatee"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"Facial Hair","key":"malegroomingkeywords++general+facial-hair","id":"malegroomingkeywords:general/facial-hair"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":true,"name":"App","key":"malegroomingkeywords++app","id":"malegroomingkeywords:app"},{"isVisibleOnWeb":false,"name":"Man","key":"malegroomingkeywords++man","id":"malegroomingkeywords:man"}],"title":"Facial hair styles "},{"portraitimage":"","previewimage":"","spotlightLogo":"","newsfeedLogo":"","modDate":"1519979680708","overlay":"","linkurl":"","partnername":"","uid":"","link":"https://stg.philips.com/c-w/malegrooming/products/face-style/a-barbers-perspective.html","imageUrl":"https://stg.philips.com/c-dam/b2c/malegroomingexperience/Germany/M%C3%84NNERPFLEGE-AUS-SICHT-EINES-HERRENFRISEURS/AUS-SICHT-EINES-HERRENFRISEURS-small.jpg","text":"<p><b>In <a href=\"http://barber.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Barber</a> it’s all about the craft of shaving and creating a relaxed moment for guys.

We do shaves, trims and skin treatments. I’m service-minded and I like to help guys achieve that rare feeling of relaxation. I was very surprised to discover that you can find a barber on every corner in Turkey but not here.. Here we are one of the happy few.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Who visits Barber?</b></p>\n<p>Our public is very diverse (from hipsters to retired lawyers) but in general we attract people with beards. More and more guys like to grow their facial hair but they also like to keep the beard neat and try different beard styles. These guys like to visit my shop, get a treatment and come out feeling great.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Have any funny things happened?</b></p>\n<p>A guy came in recently and asked for a Craig David beard style. That’s not what I do, making very thin lines on a over-styled beard. I like the classic styles, with funny little accents here and there.</p>\n<p><i>&quot;In London 1 out of 10 young men have a mustache these days&quot;</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What are the latest trends?</b></p>\n<p>That really depends on where you are. In Amsterdam the popular beard style is mainly clean shaves, stubble, short and full beards that you see on the streets. Occasionally you see more eccentric styles like a handlebar combined with a beard, but not that often. In London 1 out of 10 young men have a mustache these days. With Movember getting more and more popular, the mustache trend’s going to continue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Do you have any shaving tips? &nbsp;</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Follow your facial hair line and choose the hair length that best suits your face. If your facial hair is a bit patchy, don’t go for a short beard.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Guys who don’t have a lot of facial hair can always try to grow a beard and see how it looks; a scruffy beard without a lot of hair can still look good.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<ol>\n<li>In general it’s all about trying out different beard styles (every face is unique) and seeing what looks good on you. You’ll find out yourself what you like best; it’s just a case of experimenting.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What’s the craziest beard style you’ve ever seen in your barbershop?</b></p>\n<p>A guy walked in recently with these really high mutton chops, kind of sideburns gone mad.
